# CHAPTER 1: Overview

## Introduction

RabbitMax Flex is an open source hardware Raspberry Pi HAT for Internet of Things (IoT). RabbitMax Flex was started as a hobby project by Leon Anavi in 2016. It is suitable for do it yourself (DIY) weather station, automated desk assistant or rapid prototyping Internet of Things (IoT).

RabbitMax Flex is designed with the free and open source electronics design automation suite KiCAD. No soldering is required. You can assemple RabbitMax Flex to your Raspberry Pi with your bare hands.

RabbitMax is fully compatible with the Raspbian GNU/Linux distribution and open source sample applications are provided. RabbitMax Flex also supports its own RabbitMax IoT GNU/Linux distribution which is based on the Yocto Project and Openembedded and features open source daemon for communicating with other Internet ot Things (IoT) through the lightweight machine-to-machine connectivity protocol MQTT.

## Features

RabbitMax Flex Raspberry Pi HAT includes:

* Relay
* IR LED
* IR photo sensor
* Piezo buzzer
* Button
* RGB LED
* Slot for modular LCD character display
* Slots for up to 5 plug and play I2C sensors

## Supported Raspberry Pi Versions and Models

RabbitMax Flex is compatible with the following Raspberry Pi version and models:

* Raspberry Pi 3
