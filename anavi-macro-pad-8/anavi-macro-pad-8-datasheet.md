The Maker Kit is for advanced users only. It requires soldering, but provides you the opportunity to pick your own mechanical switches (compatible with Cherry MX plate footprint), color of 3 mm backlit LEDs, and keycaps.

#### Acrylic Case (CS-ANAVI-MP8-3)

This enclosure gives your ANAVI Macro Pad 8 a bit of protection, lifts the board off the table so the underlighting is maximally effective, and helps keep the board in place with four rubber bumpers. The acrylic panels are screwed together easily with included hardware.

#### Mini OLED Display (CS-ANAVI-DISPLAY-1)

A 0.96" mini OLED display that connects with the board over an IÂ²C interface. A short extension cable is also included if you'd rather have the display slightly separate from the board. The display can be programmed with whatever information you want through Arduino IDE.

#### Switches, keycaps and red LEDs	(CS-ANAVI-MP8-4)

8 Gateron red switches, translucent keycaps and 3mm red LEDs as components for soldering. Suitable for ANAVI Macro Pad 8 Maker Kit (CS-ANAVI-MP8-2).
